                    <h2>Chernobyl disaster</h2>
                    <h4>26 April 1986</h4>
                    <div class="paragraph p-4">
                        <p>The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred 
                        on 26 April 1986 at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear
                        Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian 
                        SSR in the Soviet Union.It is considered the worst nuclear disaster 
                        in history both in cost and casualties. It is one of only two nuclear energy 
                        accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale,
                        the other being the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. The initial emergency response,
                        together with later decontamination of the environment, involved more than 500,000 personnel and 
                        cost an estimated 18 billion Soviet rubles—roughly US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation.
                        </p>
                        <p>The accident occurred during a safety test on the steam 
                        turbine of an RBMK-type nuclear reactor. During a planned 
                        decrease of reactor power in preparation for the test, the
                        power output unexpectedly dropped to near-zero. The operators
                        were unable to restore the power level specified by the test 
                        program, which put the reactor in an unstable condition. This
                        risk was not made evident in the operating instructions, so the
                        operators proceeded with the test. Upon test completion, the operators
                        triggered a reactor shutdown. However, a combination of operator negligence 
                        and critical design flaws had made the reactor primed to explode. Instead of 
                        shutting down, an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction began, releasing enormous 
                        amounts of energy.</p>
                        <p>The core melted down and two or more explosions ruptured the reactor core 
                        and destroyed the reactor building. This was immediately followed by an 
                        open-air reactor core fire. It released considerable airborne radioactive 
                        contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto other parts of the 
                        USSR and Western Europe, before finally ending on 4 May 1986. Some 70% 
                        of fallout landed in Belarus, 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) away. The fire released 
                        about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion. As a result of
                        rising ambient radiation levels off-site, a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) radius exclusion 
                        zone was created 36 hours after the accident. About 49,000 people were evacuated 
                        from the area, primarily from Pripyat. The exclusion zone was later increased to 30 
                        kilometres (19 mi) when a further 68,000 people were evacuated from the wider area,
                        and later it became the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone covering an area of approximately 2,600 km2
                        (1,000 sq mi).</p>
